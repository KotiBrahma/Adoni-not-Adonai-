# 33 Koti: Number of Gods and Goddesses in Hinduism

Since my childhood we were taught by our parents that there
are 33 Koti (crore or 10 million) Gods in Hinduism. 33 koti
gods = 8 Vasus + 11 Rudras + 12 Adityas + Indra and
Prajapati ( 8+ 11 + 12 + 2 = 33). If we consider koti means
prakar {kind} 33 crores is the complete population of
devatas. I mean if a human child is called human then child
of devata also called devi or devata. And we know that
devatas also have their family so I think 33 crore is the full
population of devatas they have certain ability to control
their population that's why they are called devata. 33 crore is
also an indication for India that control your population up to
33 crore in order to get best result from India.
Now come back to the 33 crores of gods in Hindu religion or
call it sanātana dharma because our ancient rishis and sages
have spiritually proved that there are totally 33 crores of
gods in universe. In the universe there are 33 crores of
planets like earth where there is life and every planet if you
consider at least one master or one god, there are totally 33
crores of gods. One thing is sure that only one animal is
there on our earth who also exists in all the33 crores of
planets. And that is cow. Therefore it is said that 33 crores of
gods stay in her body and therefore she is called as gomata
and Krishna has protected her upliftment. She is giving her
milk in all the 33 crores of worlds. Eating her flesh is a dire
sin whoever he may be
The word koti in 'trayastrimsati koti' does not mean the
number '33 crore' or '330 million'. Here koti means
'supreme', pre-eminent, excellent, that is, the 33 'supreme'
divinities. The 33 deities are: (Source Wikipedia)

Names of all 33 Vedic deities: 12 Adityas (personified
deities) correspond to the 12 Solar months and represent
different attributes of social life. The Vedic sages especially
venerated the Adityas and Vedas are full of hymns dedicated
to Indra, Agni, Surya, Varun and the like.

of other Adityas) 2. Ansh (due share), 3. Aryaman (nobility),

· 1 - Ātmā (spiritual self)
In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the 11 Rudras are
represented by ten vital energies (rudra-prana) in the body
and the eleventh one being the Ātman (the soul):
katame rudra iti | dasheme purushhe prana AtmaikAdashas
te yadA.asm AchchharIrAnmarty Adutkr Amanty atha
rodayanti tadyadrodayanti tasmAdrudrA iti || 4 ||
‘Which are the Rudras ?’ ‘The ten organs in the human body,
with the prana as the tenth and the atma as the eleventh.
When they depart from this mortal body, they make (one’s
relatives) weep. Because they then make them weep,
therefore they are called Rudras.’
- Brihadaranyaka Upanishad III-ix-4: ‘
Sources:- Rig Veda, Atharva Veda, Yajur Veda, and Part 9 of
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad where Sage Yajnavalkya is
questioned by Sage Sakalya. Even though the Vedic texts
point out towards a naturalistic pantheistic or even
polytheistic philosophy - if we go slightly deeper, we can
identify the following core values of Sanatana Dharma/Hindu
faith:
- There is a one, all-pervasive Supreme Being who is both
immanent & transcendent, both Creator and Unmanifest
Reality.
- No one path/religion teaches the only way to salvation
above all others, but that all genuine paths are facets of
God's Light, deserving respect and understanding.
- Karma is the law of cause & effect by which each individual
creates his/her own destiny by thoughts, words & actions.
- The Soul reincarnates, evolving through many births until
all karmas have been resolved, and moksha (liberation) from
the cycle of rebirth, is attained. Not a single soul will be
deprived of this destiny.
- ALL life forms are sacred, to be loved & revered, so you
have to follow Ahimsa - non-injury.
- Divinity exists in unseen worlds and temple worship, rituals,
sacraments & personal devotions can help in connecting
with God. Thus God can be worshiped in many forms - as
Krishna, Ganesha, Kaali, Durga, Shiva, Surya, Agni or any
other form/name.
As the Rigveda Richa (1/164/46) proclaims: God is called
Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, Divya, Suparna, Garutmaan, Yama
and Maatarishvaa etc. but God is one, wise call him by many
names. Therefore, in the end of the number of names of the
same God do not really matter. What matters is that
Truth/God is one - it can be called by various names by
various people.
Actually all the God's and goddesses represent different
things in nature we need to respect.. or the vehicles they
use, so called favorite animals or flowers or fruits are
mentioned so that we protect them because now we have a
purpose to save them ( to worship). Even while talking about
solution to horoscopic faults, they say a particular nakshatra
people should worship a particular tree so that groups of
people get engaged in saving few group of trees and rivers.
So all have their own importance, but in my view, Lord
Krishna is best , because he's not just a god, He's a mentor,
he motivated a depressed warrior called Arjuna and his
brothers too. He is known for his style of planning, doing tit
for tat . Read Mahabharata, that's best book I can suggest if
you want to know what's right and what's wrong to do.
His life is a teaching, he best suits as a role model to youth
today. His teachings in Shrimad Bhagwad Geeta can
motivate anyone. That epic is actually included in syllabus to
many educational institutions. He's a lover who said'
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'( treat whole world as your family).
He's a fighter who knows time is ultimate killer. In my view
the best quote is “ life's unfairness doesn't give you the right
to go in wrong path.” Because out of depression and
frustration many people take this decision.
I found a reference in the Bhagavat Purana to 30 million
demigods. Each planet in the universe represents a
demigod. So there are many demigods, but only one
Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that's Krishna.

funerary functions and offered oblations of water. After
bathing in the river, she offered obeisances to various
demigods situated in the sky in the different planetary
systems. She then circumambulated the fire and, while
thinking of the lotus feet of her husband, entered its flames.
> Shrimad Bhagavatam, 4.23.22
The entrance of a chaste wife into the flames of the pyre of
her dead husband is known as aha, which means "dying with
the husband" This system of saha-gamana had been
practiced in Vedic civilization from time immemorial. Even
after the British period in India this practice was rigidly
observed, but soon it degraded to the point that even when
the wife was not strong enough to enter the fire of her dead
husband, the relatives would force her to enter. Thus this
practice had to be stopped, but even today there are still
some solitary cases where a wife will voluntarily enter the fire
and die with her husband. Even after 1940 we personally
knew of a chaste wife who died in this way.
Someone asked the same question and Swami Vivekananda
gave answer in many forms in speeches and in his books.
Each tribe revers their “own”, owned god or goddess or both
together. Not at a time all the forms of Gods and Goddess.
This is the first step one need to understand before getting
on to a conclusion of all are revered at a time. A Vishnu
Bhakt revers Vishnu in one form or other form but not all the
1000+ forms. Ok …..even if so………can some one show me a
place, to place that many number of idols or portraits.…
Trimurthy + Sun( includes dwa Dasha Aditya) + Moon +
Tridevi + family deity + Vishwa deva + our lineage grand
parents + Guru, this is maximum.
Adi Shankara devised 5 main deity method. This is ultimate.
For some tribes Tulja Bhavani is their main deity and for
some tribes Goddess Saraswati is main deity. And for me
Tulja Bhavani = Goddess Saraswati. A man is a son to his
parents and is a brother to his siblings and friend to his like
minded and a husband to his wife, father to his children,
father in law to his Grandpa to his and so on. The same
person has many relationship titles based on the kind of
relation. He's the same one person but responds to each call
differently, Assume all the family is together at a time, now
he can't use his different portraits for each relationship.
He remains same where as others perceive their relationship
with him according to their respective lineage. God is one
one, he's neither male or female. Neither is of form or
formless. Give no odour, taste or can't be seen with naked
eyes. He's all over same for all humans in a single formless
form. He's inaudible to both ears but audible. The universe is
one and he reflects like stars and we get into an illusion that
each shining star is self luminating. Sakal Dev Devatabhyo
